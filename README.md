# Stone-Paper-Scissors
A console-based Rock Paper Scissors game written in C++. Play 1â€“10 rounds against the computer with real-time results and colored outputs: green for wins, red for losses, yellow for draws. The program tracks statistics, shows the final winner, and allows replay. Great for practicing C++ basics like enums, structs, and random numbers.
